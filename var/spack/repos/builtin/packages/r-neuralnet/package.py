    Training of neural networks using backpropagation, resilient

    (Riedmiller and Braun, 1993) or the modified globally convergent version by
    Anastasiadis et al. (2005). The package allows flexible settings through
    custom-choice of error and activation function. Furthermore, the
    calculation of generalized weights (Intrator O & Intrator N, 1993) is
    implemented."""
